# Noor Rashid

I build production ML systems from first principles. Oxford educated, currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at WSET where I've delivered an automated A/B testing platform generating high six figure revenue and an agentic RAG system using Redis and Pinecone.

This portfolio documents how I learn: by implementing algorithms from scratch, understanding the maths deeply enough to make informed engineering decisions when systems need to scale.

## Current Project

**[Building Recommender Systems from Linear Algebra](https://noor-rashid.github.io/noor-rashid-portfolio/projects/recommender-system/)**

Implementing collaborative filtering with ALS on MovieLens 100K. Not using library black boxes. Starting with matrix factorisation, deriving the update equations as ridge regression, and building evaluation metrics from scratch. The goal is intuition that transfers to production systems.

## Technical Stack

Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, SQL, Docker, FastAPI, Redis, Pinecone, AWS
