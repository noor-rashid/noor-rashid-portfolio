I build production ML systems from first principles. My approach is to implement algorithms from scratch, understand the mathematics deeply, then make informed engineering decisions when systems need to scale.

Currently a Senior Data Scientist at WSET, where I've built an automated A/B testing platform generating high six figure revenue and an agentic RAG system with purchase based recommendations using Redis and Pinecone.

### Building Recommender Systems from Linear Algebra

Implementing collaborative filtering with ALS on MovieLens 100K. This project covers matrix factorisation from first principles, deriving update equations as ridge regression, and building evaluation metrics including NDCG and hit rate. The goal is not to use library black boxes but to understand what happens under the hood well enough to make production decisions.
