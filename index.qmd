### Portfolio Under Construction

I'm currently building production-quality ML projects to showcase here. Each project will demonstrate end-to-end capabilities from data engineering through deployment and monitoring.

**Coming Soon:**
- Recommendation system with collaborative filtering at scale
- Time-series forecasting with uncertainty quantification
- NLP application with fine-tuned transformers

Check back soon or [connect with me](#contact) to discuss my work in progress.
