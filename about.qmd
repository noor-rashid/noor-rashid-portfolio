title: "About"
---

I'm a Senior Data Scientist at a leading drinks company, promoted from Data Analyst within eight months of joining. My work focuses on building ML systems that create measurable commercial impact.

Before transitioning to data science, I spent eight years as a Senior Instructional Designer at a Saudi Aramco company, designing curriculum for over 100,000 students. That background shapes how I approach learning and documentation, that is, systematically, with clear explanations and concrete examples before abstract theory.

## What I've Built

At my current employment, I've delivered two significant systems. The first is an automated A/B testing platform that has generated high six figure revenue by enabling faster experimentation cycles. The second is an agentic RAG system with purchase based recommendations, built using Redis for caching and Pinecone for vector search.

## Technical Focus

My current learning is centred on recommendation systems and deep learning for ranking. I'm working through the fundamentals by implementing algorithms from scratch in NumPy before reaching for library abstractions. The goal is to build intuition that transfers when these systems need to scale or when something breaks in production.

I work primarily in Python, with experience across PyTorch, scikit-learn, SQL, Docker, FastAPI, and AWS services including SageMaker and EC2.

## Education

**University of Oxford, B.A. English Literature and Language, 2.1**

## What I'm Looking For

Senior Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer roles at organisations that value end to end ownership from research through to production. I'm particularly interested in teams working on ranking, recommendation, and personalisation systems at scale.
