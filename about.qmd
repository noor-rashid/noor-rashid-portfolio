## Background

I'm a data scientist and machine learning engineer with a passion for building production systems that create measurable business impact. My journey began at Oxford University, where I developed a strong foundation in statistical modeling and computational methods.

**Current Focus:** Transitioning from analytics-focused DS work into ML Engineering leadership roles, with deep dives into MLOps, distributed systems, and real-time inference architecture.
